<p>- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 2d animations for Multi Animator Projects as a side hobby.</p>
<p>- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, C#, JavaScript, and Python.</p>
<p>- âš¡ Fun fact: I am obsessed with vintage Nintendo consoles/cartridges (especially PokÃ©mon related games) and love to collect as many as I can. The Gameboy Advance SP and DS Lite are personal favorites of mine.</p>
